As College Students, we have faced the stuggle of finding parking in downtown and dense cities. We believe that there needs to be a better parking solution. We came up with ParkR to solve this problem. ParkR allows users to add street parking spots and rate them in our ever growing database of parking spots. We also have incorporated useful data analytic tools such as a heat map for users and city planners alike to figure out where parking is busy. We believe that the same way Uber and Lyft have changed the way we get to our destinations, our product is going to revolutionize the way we treat public parking spaces. In addition to increased ease of parking, ParkR will be beneficial in reducing emmissions and potentially getting millions of people who circle city blocks for parking, to get parking faster and more efficiently.
